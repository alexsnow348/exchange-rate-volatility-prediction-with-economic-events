### Findings

Paper One: [Impact of macroeconomic announcements on foreign exchange volatility: Evidence from South Africa](papers/paper1.pdf)

1. After the release of a news announcement, the level of foreign exchange volatility rises. This is independent of whether the news item surprised the market or not.

2. Both South African and US news items significantly impact USD/ZAR volatility, suggesting that the news items are being used to formulate investor expectations regarding the future prospects of the currency pair.

3. Negative news appears to have a greater impact on exchange rate volatility relative to positive news. This result is also state dependent, as investors tend to behave differently to news depending on the economic climate at that point in time.

4. Investor cognitive biases give rise to the asymmetric news effects on exchange rate volatility.

5. Finally, investors do not always act in rational manner, especially when faced with multiple news items that are contradictory to each other.


Paper Two: [A Survey of Announcement Effects on Foreign Exchange Volatility and Jumps by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](papers/paper2.pdf)

1. Scheduled and unscheduled news typically raises volatility for about an hour and often causes price discontinuities or jumps.

2. News contributes substantially to volatility but other factors contribute even more to periodic volatility. The same types of news that affect returns—payrolls, trade balance, and interest rate shocks—are also the most likely to affect volatility.

3. U.S. news tends to produce more volatility than foreign news.

4. Volatility might depend on a number of factors: the precision of the information in the news, the state of the business cycle, and the heterogeneity of traders’ beliefs.


Paper Three: [News announcements, market activity and volatility in the euro/dollar foreign exchange market](papers/paper3.pdf)

1. we show that volatility increases in the pre-announcement periods, particularly before scheduled events.

2. Market activity also significantly impacts return volatility as expected by the theoretical literature on the order flow.

3. Used EGARCH model, GARCH models,  flexible Fourier form

4. For scheduled announcements, an abnormal increase in volatility during the pre-announcement period can be linked to speculative trades initiated on the basis of anticipations, or to traders who close their positions to avoid ‘surprises’when the news is released.

5.  Announcements have a significant positive effect, but for a very short period of time


Paper Four: [News implied volatility and long-term foreign exchange market volatility](papers/paper4.pdf)

1. Stock Markets and Government have a more significantly positive ,long-run spillover impact on the volatility of currencies.

2. Although natural disasters and wars are rare,the news regarding them produces highly destructive impacts on society and exerts an influence on relevant currencies.


Paper Five: [Macroeconomic announcements and price discovery in theforeign exchange market](papers/paper5.pdf)

1. Macroeconomic announcements affect the pattern of price discovery across different markets.

2. A significant increase in price discovery before the announcement suggests the possibility of information leakage, while enhanced price discovery efficacy after the announcement suggests that prices gradually adjust to new information, not just immediately respond to the arrival of announcements.
