# Volatility with macroeconomic announcements

### Question:

***We assume that the best prediction of the volatility of an FX rate over the next 60 minutes is  the historic volatility of that FX rate over the previous 60 minutes.
We now wish to enhance that volatility prediction by incorporating what is known about upcoming economic events (from the dataset provided by www.forexfactory.com).
Please propose, in as much detail as you can, a method for incorporating the economic events information into the volatility prediction.
Kindly include your explanation of the model and code if you have any.***
