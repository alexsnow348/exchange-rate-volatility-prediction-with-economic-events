# Volatility with Economic event


We assume that the best prediction of the volatility of an FX rate over the next 60 minutes is  the historic volatility of that FX rate over the previous 60 minutes.
We now wish to enhance that volatility prediction by incorporating what is known about upcoming economic events (from the dataset provided by www.forexfactory.com).
Please propose, in as much detail as you can, a method for incorporating the economic events information into the volatility prediction.
Kindly include your explanation of the model and code if you have any.


### Findings

Paper One: [Impact of macroeconomic announcements on foreign exchange volatility: Evidence from South Africa](papers/paper1.pdf)

1. After the release of a news announcement, the level of foreign exchange volatility rises. This is independent of whether the news item surprised the market or not.

2. Both South African and US news items significantly impact USD/ZAR volatility, suggesting that the news items are being used to formulate investor expectations regarding the future prospects of the currency pair.

3. Negative news appears to have a greater impact on exchange rate volatility relative to positive news. This result is also state dependent, as investors tend to behave differently to news depending on the economic climate at that point in time.

4. Investor cognitive biases give rise to the asymmetric news effects on exchange rate volatility.

5. Finally, investors do not always act in rational manner, especially when faced with multiple news items that are contradictory to each other.
